# SudokuSolver
A simple backtracking sudoku solver, GUI will come.

For any normal sudoku this solver takes under half a second, but can take longer if the sudoku is set up to be anti brute force.


This was my first non-uni project, coming to life because I thought I could build this quicker than dad could solve one normally (I was wrong).
